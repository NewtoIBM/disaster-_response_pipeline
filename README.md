# disaster_response_pipeline
This project was complex: It included Lemmatization, tokenization. My data was not ready initially. I had to make sure no missing data. ETL is used(Extract Transform Load). Final data stage was all disaster categories are split into column names and their values are 0 and 1. 1 is for yes and 0 is for no. The complexity of this problem was multioutput classification where I have 36 categories and computer classifies messages into which category of a disaster response(aid, military) it belongs.
